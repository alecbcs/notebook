# notebook

This notebook is a record of some things I've learned, some things I wish I knew sooner, and some thoughts of mine. 

Our Brains are like a computer's CPU & RAM, they're fast at recording and processing information, but over time that information degrades and when we turn off, much like computer memory, all that information is lost unless saved somewhere else. As such, I'm hoping to make this repository my hard drive and maybe some day it will help out someone else in my shoes.

I was inspired by [Azer Ko√ßulu](https://github.com/azer/notebook) to start this project.
